#SchedGrid.html:

2015 New York Mets schedule. Responsive web design using Bootstrap 3.0, reformatting based on browser width.

Implemented as a static HTML page with styles inline for easy distribution. (This would not be a standard approach - ordinarily, the calendar would be created in a dynamic manner and schedule data would be loaded in from a data file of some sort.)
